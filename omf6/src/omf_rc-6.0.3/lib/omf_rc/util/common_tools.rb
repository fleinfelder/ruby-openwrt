# This module defines a Utility with some common work blocks that could be
# useful to any type of Resource Proxy (RP)
#
module OmfRc::Util::CommonTools
  include OmfRc::ResourceProxyDSL

  # This utility block logs an error/warn String S on the resource proxy side
  # and publish an INFORM message on the resources pubsub topic. This INFORM
  # message will have the type ERROR/WARN, and its 'reason' element set to the
  # String S
  #
  # @yieldparam [String] msg the error or warning message
  #
  %w(error warn).each do |type|
    work("log_inform_#{type}") do |res, msg|
      logger.send(type, msg)

        res.uid,
        OmfCommon::Message.create(:inform, { reason: msg }, { itype: type.upcase })
      )
    end
  end

  # This utility block returns true if its given value parameter is a Boolean,
  # which in Ruby means that it is either of the class TrueClass or FalseClass
  #
  # @yieldparam [Object] obj the Object to test as Boolean
  #
  # [Boolean] true or fals
  #
  work('boolean?') do |res,obj|
